# BootStrap_Blog_Website

I used Flask Framework,Bootstrap and a template from Start Bootstrap to create a fully functional, responsive blog website with blogs that can be updated using the N Point API. All the information will be delivered to my email address along with a contact from when the message was filed. By including the data in the API, blogs can be updated.

The website's backend was written in the Python programming language using the Flask Framework.
